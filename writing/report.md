#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

I used the Interactive demo for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the alignment software
that we developed in class to get a better picture of what the alignment looked like.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 From what I was able to extrapolate from the results is that the sequences are quite
 similar to one another with the exception of a few mismatches and gaps.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

I would like to argue that there is a distinct possibility that the sequences
are related to each other. There did not appear to be very many gaps and the mismatches
appeared to be mostly centralized on the extremities.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


 The proof that I have of the claim would be the global and local alignment comparisons
 that I ran on the software developed in class. The results were able to insinuate that
 there was quite a similarity between the sequences.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

In order to differentiate between the sequences as easily as possible I referred to them by the year that pertains to each one. Between 2005 and 2006 there is a similarity of 95.2% which is the lowest of the comparisons I made. The following comparison was between 2006 and 2007 which had the highest similarity at 97.5%. Finally, 2005 and 2007 were at about the middle of the road with a similarity at 96.0%.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


From what little information I was able to gather from this there is a chance that the virus could adapt considering how similar the sequences from how similar A_avian_Hong_Kong_719_2007_ and A_China_GD01_2006_ are. Although I do not feel as though my perspective would amount to much considering how I am really basing this of of how close the sequences are to being at 100%. To me it appears as though the difference is really small since the numbers in the results are so high which could lead to me to make a false positive because of that bias. As such, I could be wrong considering that some of the sequences that we saw in class were mostly along the lines of 99% and 100% fairly often which could be the norm for meriting concern.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?
